I am a researcher and advocate interested in the impacts of emerging technologies on people's experiences at work. Broadly I aim to help resolve the gap between the deployment of platform technologies and the design and enforcement of public policy - in other words, I aim to support the growing portion of the workforce who are evaluated and managed by algorithms and AI. This looks like: [participatory research] with workers to understand their firsthand experiences, [collaborating with labor unions] to evaluate novel labor protections, and ongoing [tracking and analysis] of proposed and enacted legislation in these areas. My current research focuses on the app-based service industry - including ridehail (Uber, Lyft), food and package delivery (DoorDash, Amazon Flex), and ghost kitchens. 

I'm currently a PhD student at the [University of Washington Information School](https://ischool.uw.edu/), advised by [Dr. Nic Weber](https://ischool.uw.edu/people/faculty/profile/nmweber). Prior to graduate school, I worked as a pastry chef and archivist in Philadelphia, PA.
