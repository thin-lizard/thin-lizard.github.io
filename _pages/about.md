I am a researcher and advocate interested in the impacts of emerging technologies on people's experiences at work. Broadly I aim to help resolve the gap between the deployment of platform technologies and the design and enforcement of public policy - in other words, I aim to support the growing portion of the workforce who are evaluated and managed by technologies such as algorithms and AI. This looks like: [participatory research] with workers to understand their firsthand experiences, [collaborating with labor unions] to evaluate novel labor protections, and (policy analysis). My current research focuses on the app-based service industry - including ridehail (Uber, Lyft), food and package delivery (DoorDash, Amazon Flex), and ghost kitchens. 

I'm a PhD student at the [University of Washington Information School](https://ischool.uw.edu/), advised by [Nic Weber]. Jobs I held prior to graduate school include pastry chef, archivist, and dental lab technician.
