 	abstract = {For drivers who depend on an app in order to make a living, losing access to their account (or, being deactivated) is the equivalent of being digitally fired. Transportation Network Companies ({TNCs}) like Uber or Lyft  justify frequent and prompt driver deactivations as a matter of customer safety. However, mounting evidence shows these companies do not follow their own deactivation policies to give drivers fair warning and due process. In 2021, the City of Seattle implemented a Deactivation Rights Ordinance that was meant to improve the workplace rights of rideshare drivers. This unique legislation was the first in the {USA} to grant rideshare drivers the right to legally challenge a deactivation through a dispute arbitration process. This report evaluates the impact of Seattle’s Deactivation Rights Ordinance ({DRO}) and the performance of the Driver Resolution Center ({DRC}) from July 1, 2021 through January 31, 2023. We rely upon data from three empirical studies: A survey of 134 Seattle-area drivers; Focus groups with 16 Seattle-area rideshare drivers; and, a statistical analysis of {\textasciitilde}1400 deactivation cases from July 2021-January 2023. The findings contribute to recent research on account deactivation in app-based gig work, but are notably the first to utilize verified deactivation data.}

	shorttitle = {Asymmetric by Design},
	abstract = {Information asymmetries are a key feature of platform capitalism - they allow large multinational companies to exploit workers, and dodge regulation at all levels of government. In the following paper, we evaluate the impact of three experimental policies meant to regulate platforms and protect gig work in Seattle, {WA}. Drawing on focus groups and interviews with over 100 gig workers we describe how information asymmetries impede workers’ awareness of new rights and access to policy benefits. We describe how platform labor regulation faces a sociotechnical gap between policy design and implementation. We show that this gap cannot be bridged when platform companies, who rely upon information asymmetries to turn a profit, are responsible for communicating emerging workplace rights. We conclude by outlining three public policy implications from our work: 1. Distributing responsibility in the enforcement of platform regulations; 2. Involving gig workers in policy design and implementation; 3. Addressing information asymmetries in regulating platform companies, including but not limited to the gig economy.},
